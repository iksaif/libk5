Don't forget to set theses variables correctly:
- CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
- CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX

Install Kerberos for Windows
Install CMake and add it to your path

If you want to build something that you can distribute without
any issue, don't forget -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release !

For Visual C++:

 - Open a shell with vc env correctly defined (there is a .bat for that)
 - cmake .. -DKRB5_KFW_PATH="c:/Program Files/MIT/Kerberos/"
 - make
 - make install

For MinGW 32:

 - Open a shell with vc env correctly defined (there is a .bat for that)
 - cmake .. -DKRB5_KFW_PATH="c:/Program Files/MIT/Kerberos/" -G"MinGW Makefiles"
 - make
 - make install

 - cmake ..
 - make
 - sudo make install

Mac-OS X
